                        "Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in March suggests that the\neconomy has been expanding moderately.",
                        "Labor market conditions have improved in recent\nmonths; the unemployment rate has declined but remains elevated.",
                        "Household spending and\nbusiness fixed investment have continued to advance.",
                        "Despite some signs of improvement, the\nhousing sector remains depressed.",
                        "Inflation has picked up somewhat, mainly reflecting higher\nprices of crude oil and gasoline.",
                        "However, longer-term inflation expectations have remained\nstable.\nConsistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and\nprice stability.",
                        "The Committee expects economic growth to remain moderate over coming\nquarters and then to pick up gradually.",
                        "Consequently, the Committee anticipates that the\nunemployment rate will decline gradually toward levels that it judges to be consistent with its\ndual mandate.",
                        "Strains in global financial markets continue to pose significant downside risks to\nthe economic outlook.",
                        "The increase in oil and gasoline prices earlier this year is expected to\naffect inflation only temporarily, and the Committee anticipates that subsequently inflation will\nrun at or below the rate that it judges most consistent with its dual mandate.\nTo support a stronger economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at the\nrate most consistent with its dual mandate, the Committee expects to maintain a highly\naccommodative stance for monetary policy.",
                        "In particular, the Committee decided today to keep\nthe target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to  percent and currently anticipates that\neconomic conditionsincluding low rates of resource utilization and a subdued outlook for\ninflation over the medium runare likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds\nrate at least through late 2014.\nThe Committee also decided to continue its program to extend the average maturity of its\nholdings of securities as announced in September.",
                        "The Committee is maintaining its existing\npolicies of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency\nmortgagebacked securities and of rolling over maturing\nTreasury securities at auction.",
                        "The Committee will regularly review the size and composition of\nits securities holdings and is prepared to adjust those holdings as appropriate to promote a\nstronger economic recovery in a context of price stability."
