                        "However, a range of labor market indicators\nsuggests that there remains significant underutilization of labor resources.",
                        "Household spending\nappears to be rising moderately and business fixed investment is advancing, while the recovery\nin the housing sector remains slow.",
                        "Fiscal policy is restraining economic growth, although the\nextent of restraint is diminishing.",
                        "Inflation has moved somewhat closer to the Committee's\nlongerterm inflation expectations have remained stable.\nConsistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and\nprice stability.",
                        "The Committee expects that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic\nactivity will expand at a moderate pace, with labor market indicators and inflation moving toward\nlevels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate.",
                        "The Committee sees the risks to\nthe outlook for economic activity and the labor market as nearly balanced and judges that the\nlikelihood of inflation running persistently below 2 percent has diminished somewhat.\nThe Committee currently judges that there is sufficient underlying strength in the broader\neconomy to support ongoing improvement in labor market conditions.",
                        "In light of the cumulative\nprogress toward maximum employment and the improvement in the outlook for labor market\nconditions since the inception of the current asset purchase program, the Committee decided to\nmake a further measured reduction in the pace of its asset purchases.",
                        "Beginning in August, the\nCommittee will add to its holdings of agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of $10 billion\nper month rather than $15 billion per month, and will add to its holdings of longer-term Treasury\nsecurities at a pace of $15 billion per month rather than $20 billion per month.",
                        "The Committee is\nmaintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt\nand agency mortgagebacked securities and of rolling\nover maturing Treasury securities at auction.",
                        "The Committee's sizable and still-increasing\nholdings of longerterm interest\nrates, support mortgage markets, and help to make broader financial conditions more\naccommodative, which in turn should promote a stronger economic recovery and help to ensure\nthat inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with the Committee's dual mandate."

                        "The Committee will closely monitor incoming information on economic and financial\ndevelopments in coming months and will continue its purchases of Treasury and agency\nmortgage-backed securities, and employ its other policy tools as appropriate, until the outlook\nfor the labor market has improved substantially in a context of price stability.",
                        "If incoming\ninformation broadly supports the Committee's expectation of ongoing improvement in labor\nmarket conditions and inflation moving back toward its longer-run objective, the Committee will\nlikely reduce the pace of asset purchases in further measured steps at future meetings.\nHowever, asset purchases are not on a preset course, and the Committee's decisions about\ntheir pace will remain contingent on the Committee's outlook for the labor market and inflation as\nwell as its assessment of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases.\nTo support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee\ntoday reaffirmed its view that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy remains\nappropriate.",
                        "In determining how long to maintain the current 0 to  percent target range for the\nfederal funds rate, the Committee will assess progressboth realized and expectedtoward its\nobjectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.",
                        "This assessment will take into\naccount a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators\nof inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments.",
                        "The\nCommittee continues to anticipate, based on its assessment of these factors, that it likely will be\nappropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate for a considerable time\nafter the asset purchase program ends, especially if projected inflation continues to run below\nthe Committee's 2 percent longerterm inflation expectations\nremain well anchored.\nWhen the Committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced\napproach consistent with its longer-run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2\npercent.",
                        "The Committee currently anticipates that, even after employment and inflation are near\nmandate-consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target\nfederal funds rate below levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run."
