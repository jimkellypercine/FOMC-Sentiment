                        "Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in July indicates that the\nlabor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has been rising moderately\nso far this year.",
                        "Job gains have remained solid in recent months, and the unemployment rate\nhas stayed low.",
                        "Household spending has been expanding at a moderate rate, and growth in\nbusiness fixed investment has picked up in recent quarters.",
                        "On a 12-month basis, overall\ninflation and the measure excluding food and energy prices have declined this year and are\nrunning below 2 percent.",
                        "Market\nbased measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance.\nConsistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and\nprice stability.",
                        "Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria have devastated many communities, inflicting\nsevere hardship.",
                        "Storm-related disruptions and rebuilding will affect economic activity in the\nnear term, but past experience suggests that the storms are unlikely to materially alter the\ncourse of the national economy over the medium term.",
                        "Consequently, the Committee continues\nto expect that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will\nexpand at a moderate pace, and labor market conditions will strengthen somewhat further.\nHigher prices for gasoline and some other items in the aftermath of the hurricanes will likely\nboost inflation temporarily; apart from that effect, inflation on a 12-month basis is expected to\nremain somewhat below 2 percent in the near term but to stabilize around the Committee's 2\npercent objective over the medium term.",
                        "Near-term risks to the economic outlook appear\nroughly balanced, but the Committee is monitoring inflation developments closely.\nIn view of realized and expected labor market conditions and inflation, the Committee decided to\nmaintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 1 to 1- percent.",
                        "The stance of monetary\npolicy remains accommodative, thereby supporting some further strengthening in labor market\nconditions and a sustained return to 2 percent inflation.\nIn determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds\nrate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its\nobjectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.",
                        "This assessment will take into\naccount a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators\nof inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international"
