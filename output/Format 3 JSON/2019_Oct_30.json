                        "Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in September indicates that\nthe labor market remains strong and that economic activity has been rising at a moderate rate.\nJob gains have been solid, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate has\nremained low.",
                        "Although household spending has been rising at a strong pace, business fixed\ninvestment and exports remain weak.",
                        "On a 12-month basis, overall inflation and inflation for\nitems other than food and energy are running below 2 percent.",
                        "Market-based measures of\ninflation compensation remain low; surveyterm inflation expectations\nare little changed.\nConsistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and\nprice stability.",
                        "In light of the implications of global developments for the economic outlook as well\nas muted inflation pressures, the Committee decided to lower the target range for the federal\nfunds rate to  percent.",
                        "This action supports the Committee's view that sustained\nexpansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the\nCommittee's symmetric 2 percent objective are the most likely outcomes, but uncertainties\nabout this outlook remain.",
                        "The Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming\ninformation for the economic outlook as it assesses the appropriate path of the target range for\nthe federal funds rate.\nIn determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds\nrate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its\nmaximum employment objective and its symmetric 2 percent inflation objective.",
                        "This\nassessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor\nmarket conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on\nfinancial and international developments."
