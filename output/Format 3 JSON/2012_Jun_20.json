                        "Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in April suggests that the\neconomy has been expanding moderately this year.",
                        "However, growth in employment has\nslowed in recent months, and the unemployment rate remains elevated.",
                        "Business fixed\ninvestment has continued to advance.",
                        "Household spending appears to be rising at a somewhat\nslower pace than earlier in the year.",
                        "Despite some signs of improvement, the housing sector\nremains depressed.",
                        "Inflation has declined, mainly reflecting lower prices of crude oil and\ngasoline, and longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable.\nConsistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and\nprice stability.",
                        "The Committee expects economic growth to remain moderate over coming\nquarters and then to pick up very gradually.",
                        "Consequently, the Committee anticipates that the\nunemployment rate will decline only slowly toward levels that it judges to be consistent with its\ndual mandate.",

                        "The Committee anticipates that inflation over the\nmedium term will run at or below the rate that it judges most consistent with its dual mandate.\nTo support a stronger economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at the\nrate most consistent with its dual mandate, the Committee expects to maintain a highly\naccommodative stance for monetary policy.",
                        "In particular, the Committee decided today to keep\nthe target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to  percent and currently anticipates that\neconomic conditionsincluding low rates of resource utilization and a subdued outlook for\ninflation over the medium runare likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds\nrate at least through late 2014.\nThe Committee also decided to continue through the end of the year its program to extend the\naverage maturity of its holdings of securities.",
                        "Specifically, the Committee intends to purchase\nTreasury securities with remaining maturities of 6 years to 30 years at the current pace and to\nsell or redeem an equal amount of Treasury securities with remaining maturities of\napproximately 3 years or less.",
                        "This continuation of the maturity extension program should put\ndownward pressure on longer-term interest rates and help to make broader financial conditions\nmore accommodative.",
