                        "Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in September suggests that\neconomic activity has continued to expand at a moderate pace in recent months.\u00a0 Growth in\nemployment has been slow, and the unemployment rate remains elevated.\u00a0 Household\nspending has advanced a bit more quickly, but growth in business fixed investment has slowed.\u00a0\nThe housing sector has shown some further signs of improvement, albeit from a depressed\nlevel.\u00a0 Inflation recently picked up somewhat, reflecting higher energy prices.\u00a0 Longer-term\ninflation expectations have remained stable.\nConsistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and\nprice stability.\u00a0 The Committee remains concerned that, without sufficient policy accommodation,\neconomic growth might not be strong enough to generate sustained improvement in labor\nmarket conditions.\u00a0 Furthermore, strains in global financial markets continue to pose significant\ndownside risks to the economic outlook.\u00a0 The Committee also anticipates that inflation over the\nmedium term likely would run at or below its 2 percent objective.\nTo support a stronger economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at the\nrate most consistent with its dual mandate, the Committee will continue purchasing additional\nagency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of $40 billion per month.\u00a0 The Committee also will\ncontinue through the end of the year its program to extend the average maturity of its holdings\nof Treasury securities, and it is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments\nfrom its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage\nbacked securities.\u00a0 These actions, which together will increase the Committee\u2019s holdings of\nlonger-term securities by about $85 billion each month through the end of the year, should put\ndownward pressure on longer-term interest rates, support mortgage markets, and help to make\nbroader financial conditions more accommodative.\nThe Committee will closely monitor incoming information on economic and financial\ndevelopments in coming months.\u00a0 If the outlook for the labor market does not improve\nsubstantially, the Committee will continue its purchases of agency mortgage-backed securities,\nundertake additional asset purchases, and employ its other policy tools as appropriate until such\nimprovement is achieved in a context of price stability.\u00a0 In determining the size, pace, and\ncomposition of its asset purchases, the Committee will, as always, take appropriate account of\nthe likely efficacy and costs of such purchases."
