                        "Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in June indicates that the\nlabor market remains strong and that economic activity has been rising at a moderate rate.",
                        "Job\ngains have been solid, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate has remained\nlow.",
                        "Although growth of household spending has picked up from earlier in the year, growth of\nbusiness fixed investment has been soft.",
                        "On a 12-month basis, overall inflation and inflation for\nitems other than food and energy are running below 2 percent.",
                        "Market-based measures of\ninflation compensation remain low; surveyterm inflation expectations\nare little changed.\nConsistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and\nprice stability.",
                        "In light of the implications of global developments for the economic outlook as well\nas muted inflation pressures, the Committee decided to lower the target range for the federal\nfunds rate to 2 to 2- percent.",
                        "This action supports the Committee's view that sustained\nexpansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the\nCommittee's symmetric 2 percent objective are the most likely outcomes, but uncertainties\nabout this outlook remain.",
                        "As the Committee contemplates the future path of the target range for\nthe federal funds rate, it will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the\neconomic outlook and will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion, with a strong labor\nmarket and inflation near its symmetric 2 percent objective.\nIn determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds\nrate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its\nmaximum employment objective and its symmetric 2 percent inflation objective.",
                        "This\nassessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor\nmarket conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on\nfinancial and international developments.\nThe Committee will conclude the reduction of its aggregate securities holdings in the System\nOpen Market Account in August, two months earlier than previously indicated."
