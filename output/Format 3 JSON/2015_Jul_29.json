                        "Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in June indicates that\neconomic activity has been expanding moderately in recent months.",
                        "Growth in household\nspending has been moderate and the housing sector has shown additional improvement;\nhowever, business fixed investment and net exports stayed soft.",
                        "The labor market continued to\nimprove, with solid job gains and declining unemployment.",
                        "On balance, a range of labor market\nindicators suggests that underutilization of labor resources has diminished since early this year.\nInflation continued to run below the Committee's longer-run objective, partly reflecting earlier\ndeclines in energy prices and decreasing prices of nonbased measures\nof inflation compensation remain low; survey\u2011based measures of longer-term inflation\nexpectations have remained stable.\nConsistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and\nprice stability.",
                        "The Committee expects that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic\nactivity will expand at a moderate pace, with labor market indicators continuing to move toward\nlevels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate.",
                        "The Committee continues to see\nthe risks to the outlook for economic activity and the labor market as nearly balanced.",
                        "Inflation is\nanticipated to remain near its recent low level in the near term, but the Committee expects\ninflation to rise gradually toward 2 percent over the medium term as the labor market improves\nfurther and the transitory effects of earlier declines in energy and import prices dissipate.",
                        "The\nCommittee continues to monitor inflation developments closely.\nTo support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee\ntoday reaffirmed its view that the current 0 to  percent target range for the federal funds rate\nremains appropriate.",
                        "In determining how long to maintain this target range, the Committee will\nassess progressboth realized and expectedtoward its objectives of maximum employment\nand 2 percent inflation.",
                        "This assessment will take into account a wide range of information,\nincluding measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation\nexpectations, and readings on financial and international developments.",
                        "The Committee\nanticipates that it will be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate when it\nhas seen some further improvement in the labor market and is reasonably confident that\ninflation will move back to its 2 percent objective over the medium term."
