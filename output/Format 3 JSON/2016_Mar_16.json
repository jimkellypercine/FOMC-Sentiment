                        "Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in January suggests that\neconomic activity has been expanding at a moderate pace despite the global economic and\nfinancial developments of recent months.",
                        "Household spending has been increasing at a\nmoderate rate, and the housing sector has improved further; however, business fixed\ninvestment and net exports have been soft.",
                        "A range of recent indicators, including strong job\ngains, points to additional strengthening of the labor market.",
                        "Inflation picked up in recent\nmonths; however, it continued to run below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run objective,\npartly reflecting declines in energy prices and in prices of nonbased\nmeasures of inflation compensation remain low; surveyterm inflation\nexpectations are little changed, on balance, in recent months.\nConsistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and\nprice stability.",
                        "The Committee currently expects that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of\nmonetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace and labor market indicators\nwill continue to strengthen.",

                        "Inflation is expected to remain low in the near term, in part because of earlier\ndeclines in energy prices, but to rise to 2 percent over the medium term as the transitory effects\nof declines in energy and import prices dissipate and the labor market strengthens further.",
                        "The\nCommittee continues to monitor inflation developments closely.\nAgainst this backdrop, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds\nrate at  to  percent.",
                        "The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby\nsupporting further improvement in labor market conditions and a return to 2 percent inflation.\nIn determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds\nrate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its\nobjectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.",
                        "This assessment will take into\naccount a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators\nof inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international\ndevelopments.",
                        "In light of the current shortfall of inflation from 2 percent, the Committee will\ncarefully monitor actual and expected progress toward its inflation goal.",
                        "The Committee expects\nthat economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant only gradual increases in the\nfederal funds rate; the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are"
