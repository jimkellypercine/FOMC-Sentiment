                        "Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in August suggests that\neconomic activity has continued to expand at a moderate pace in recent months.",
                        "Growth in\nemployment has been slow, and the unemployment rate remains elevated.",
                        "Household spending\nhas continued to advance, but growth in business fixed investment appears to have slowed.",
                        "The\nhousing sector has shown some further signs of improvement, albeit from a depressed level.\nInflation has been subdued, although the prices of some key commodities have increased\nrecently.",
                        "Longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable.\nConsistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and\nprice stability.",
                        "The Committee is concerned that, without further policy accommodation,\neconomic growth might not be strong enough to generate sustained improvement in labor\nmarket conditions.",

                        "The Committee also anticipates that inflation over the\nmedium term likely would run at or below its 2 percent objective.\nTo support a stronger economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at the\nrate most consistent with its dual mandate, the Committee agreed today to increase policy\naccommodation by purchasing additional agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of $40\nbillion per month.",
                        "The Committee also will continue through the end of the year its program to\nextend the average maturity of its holdings of securities as announced in June, and it is\nmaintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt\nand agency mortgagebacked securities.",
                        "These actions,\nwhich together will increase the Committee\u2019s holdings of longer-term securities by about $85\nbillion each month through the end of the year, should put downward pressure on longer-term\ninterest rates, support mortgage markets, and help to make broader financial conditions more\naccommodative.\nThe Committee will closely monitor incoming information on economic and financial\ndevelopments in coming months.",
                        "If the outlook for the labor market does not improve\nsubstantially, the Committee will continue its purchases of agency mortgage-backed securities,\nundertake additional asset purchases, and employ its other policy tools as appropriate until such\nimprovement is achieved in a context of price stability.",
