                        "Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in December suggests that\neconomic activity has been expanding at a solid pace.\u00a0 Labor market conditions have improved\nfurther, with strong job gains and a lower unemployment rate.\u00a0 On balance, a range of labor\nmarket indicators suggests that underutilization of labor resources continues to diminish.\u00a0\nHousehold spending is rising moderately; recent declines in energy prices have boosted\nhousehold purchasing power.\u00a0 Business fixed investment is advancing, while the recovery in the\nhousing sector remains slow.\u00a0 Inflation has declined further below the Committee\u2019s longer-run\nobjective, largely reflecting declines in energy prices.\u00a0 Market-based measures of inflation\ncompensation have declined substantially in recent months; survey\nterm inflation expectations have remained stable.\nConsistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and\nprice stability.\u00a0 The Committee expects that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic\nactivity will expand at a moderate pace, with labor market indicators continuing to move toward\nlevels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate.\u00a0 The Committee continues to see\nthe risks to the outlook for economic activity and the labor market as nearly balanced.\u00a0 Inflation\nis anticipated to decline further in the near term, but the Committee expects inflation to rise\ngradually toward 2 percent over the medium term as the labor market improves further and the\ntransitory effects of lower energy prices and other factors dissipate.\u00a0 The Committee continues\nto monitor inflation developments closely.\nTo support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee\ntoday reaffirmed its view that the current 0 to  percent target range for the federal funds rate\nremains appropriate.\u00a0 In determining how long to maintain this target range, the Committee will\nassess progressboth realized and expectedtoward its objectives of maximum employment\nand 2 percent inflation.\u00a0 This assessment will take into account a wide range of information,\nincluding measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation\nexpectations, and readings on financial and international developments.\u00a0 Based on its current\nassessment, the Committee judges that it can be patient in beginning to normalize the stance of\nmonetary policy.\u00a0 However, if incoming information indicates faster progress toward the\nCommittee\u2019s employment and inflation objectives than the Committee now expects, then\nincreases in the target range for the federal funds rate are likely to occur sooner than currently"
