                        "On balance, labor market conditions\nimproved somewhat further; however, the unemployment rate is little changed and a range of\nlabor market indicators suggests that there remains significant underutilization of labor\nresources.",
                        "Household spending appears to be rising moderately and business fixed investment\nis advancing, while the recovery in the housing sector remains slow.",
                        "Fiscal policy is restraining\neconomic growth, although the extent of restraint is diminishing.",
                        "Inflation has been running\nbelow the Committee's longerterm inflation expectations have remained\nstable.\nConsistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and\nprice stability.",
                        "The Committee expects that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic\nactivity will expand at a moderate pace, with labor market indicators and inflation moving toward\nlevels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate.",
                        "The Committee sees the risks to\nthe outlook for economic activity and the labor market as nearly balanced and judges that the\nlikelihood of inflation running persistently below 2 percent has diminished somewhat since early\nthis year.\nThe Committee currently judges that there is sufficient underlying strength in the broader\neconomy to support ongoing improvement in labor market conditions.",
                        "In light of the cumulative\nprogress toward maximum employment and the improvement in the outlook for labor market\nconditions since the inception of the current asset purchase program, the Committee decided to\nmake a further measured reduction in the pace of its asset purchases.",
                        "Beginning in October, the\nCommittee will add to its holdings of agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of $5 billion\nper month rather than $10 billion per month, and will add to its holdings of longer-term Treasury\nsecurities at a pace of $10 billion per month rather than $15 billion per month.",
                        "The Committee is\nmaintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt\nand agency mortgagebacked securities and of rolling\nover maturing Treasury securities at auction.",

                        "If incoming\ninformation broadly supports the Committee's expectation of ongoing improvement in labor\nmarket conditions and inflation moving back toward its longer-run objective, the Committee will\nend its current program of asset purchases at its next meeting.",
                        "However, asset purchases are\nnot on a preset course, and the Committee's decisions about their pace will remain contingent\non the Committee's outlook for the labor market and inflation as well as its assessment of the\nlikely efficacy and costs of such purchases.\nTo support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee\ntoday reaffirmed its view that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy remains\nappropriate.",

                        "The Committee currently anticipates that, even after employment and inflation are near\nmandate-consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target\nfederal funds rate below levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run."
