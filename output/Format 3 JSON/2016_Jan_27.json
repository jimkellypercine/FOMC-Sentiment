                        "Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in December suggests that\nlabor market conditions improved further even as economic growth slowed late last year.\nHousehold spending and business fixed investment have been increasing at moderate rates in\nrecent months, and the housing sector has improved further; however, net exports have been\nsoft and inventory investment slowed.",
                        "A range of recent labor market indicators, including strong\njob gains, points to some additional decline in underutilization of labor resources.",
                        "Inflation has\ncontinued to run below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run objective, partly reflecting declines\nin energy prices and in prices of nonbased measures of inflation\ncompensation declined further; surveyterm inflation expectations are\nlittle changed, on balance, in recent months.\nConsistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and\nprice stability.",
