                        "Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in September generally\nsuggests that economic activity has continued to expand at a moderate pace.",
                        "Indicators of labor\nmarket conditions have shown some further improvement, but the unemployment rate remains\nelevated.",
                        "Available data suggest that household spending and business fixed investment\nadvanced, while the recovery in the housing sector slowed somewhat in recent months.",
                        "Fiscal\npolicy is restraining economic growth.",
                        "Apart from fluctuations due to changes in energy prices,\ninflation has been running below the Committee's longerterm inflation\nexpectations have remained stable.\nConsistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and\nprice stability.",
                        "The Committee expects that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic\ngrowth will pick up from its recent pace and the unemployment rate will gradually decline toward\nlevels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate.",
                        "The Committee sees the\ndownside risks to the outlook for the economy and the labor market as having diminished, on\nnet, since last fall.",
                        "The Committee recognizes that inflation persistently below its 2 percent\nobjective could pose risks to economic performance, but it anticipates that inflation will move\nback toward its objective over the medium term.\nTaking into account the extent of federal fiscal retrenchment over the past year, the Committee\nsees the improvement in economic activity and labor market conditions since it began its asset\npurchase program as consistent with growing underlying strength in the broader economy.\nHowever, the Committee decided to await more evidence that progress will be sustained before\nadjusting the pace of its purchases.",
                        "Accordingly, the Committee decided to continue purchasing\nadditional agency mortgage\nterm Treasury securities at a pace of $45 billion per month.",
                        "The Committee is maintaining its\nexisting policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency\nmortgagebacked securities and of rolling over maturing\nTreasury securities at auction.",
                        "Taken together, these actions should maintain downward\npressure on longer-term interest rates, support mortgage markets, and help to make broader\nfinancial conditions more accommodative, which in turn should promote a stronger economic\nrecovery and help to ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with the\nCommittee's dual mandate."
