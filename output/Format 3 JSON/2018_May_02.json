                        "Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in March indicates that the\nlabor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has been rising at a\nmoderate rate.",
                        "Job gains have been strong, on average, in recent months, and the\nunemployment rate has stayed low.",
                        "Recent data suggest that growth of household spending\nmoderated from its strong fourth-quarter pace, while business fixed investment continued to\ngrow strongly.",
                        "On a 12-month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food\nand energy have moved close to 2 percent.",
                        "Market-based measures of inflation compensation\nremain low; surveyterm inflation expectations are little changed, on\nbalance.\nConsistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and\nprice stability.",
                        "The Committee expects that, with further gradual adjustments in the stance of\nmonetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace in the medium term and labor\nmarket conditions will remain strong.",
                        "Inflation on a 12-month basis is expected to run near the\nCommittee's symmetric 2 percent objective over the medium term.",
                        "Risks to the economic\noutlook appear roughly balanced.\nIn view of realized and expected labor market conditions and inflation, the Committee decided to\nmaintain the target range for the federal funds rate at  percent.",
                        "The stance of\nmonetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting strong labor market conditions and\na sustained return to 2 percent inflation.\nIn determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds\nrate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its\nobjectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.",
                        "This assessment will take into\naccount a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators\nof inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international\ndevelopments.",
                        "The Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected inflation developments\nrelative to its symmetric inflation goal.",
                        "The Committee expects that economic conditions will\nevolve in a manner that will warrant further gradual increases in the federal funds rate; the\nfederal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in"
