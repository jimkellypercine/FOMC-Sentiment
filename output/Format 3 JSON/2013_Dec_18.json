                        "Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in October indicates that\neconomic activity is expanding at a moderate pace.",
                        "Labor market conditions have shown further\nimprovement; the unemployment rate has declined but remains elevated.",
                        "Household spending\nand business fixed investment advanced, while the recovery in the housing sector slowed\nsomewhat in recent months.",
                        "Fiscal policy is restraining economic growth, although the extent of\nrestraint may be diminishing.",
                        "Inflation has been running below the Committee's longer-run\nobjective, but longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable.\nConsistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and\nprice stability.",
                        "The Committee expects that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic\ngrowth will pick up from its recent pace and the unemployment rate will gradually decline toward\nlevels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate.",

                        "The Committee's sizable and still\nterm securities should maintain downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, support\nmortgage markets, and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative, which"
