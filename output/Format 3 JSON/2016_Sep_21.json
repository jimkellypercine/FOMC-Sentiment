                        "Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in July indicates that the\nlabor market has continued to strengthen and growth of economic activity has picked up from\nthe modest pace seen in the first half of this year.",
                        "Although the unemployment rate is little\nchanged in recent months, job gains have been solid, on average.",
                        "Household spending has\nbeen growing strongly but business fixed investment has remained soft.",
                        "Inflation has continued\nto run below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run objective, partly reflecting earlier declines in\nenergy prices and in prices of nonbased measures of inflation\ncompensation remain low; most surveyterm inflation expectations\nare little changed, on balance, in recent months.\nConsistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and\nprice stability.",
                        "The Committee expects that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary\npolicy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace and labor market conditions will\nstrengthen somewhat further.",
                        "Inflation is expected to remain low in the near term, in part\nbecause of earlier declines in energy prices, but to rise to 2 percent over the medium term as\nthe transitory effects of past declines in energy and import prices dissipate and the labor market\nstrengthens further.",
                        "Near-term risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced.",
                        "The\nCommittee continues to closely monitor inflation indicators and global economic and financial\ndevelopments.\nAgainst this backdrop, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds\nrate at  to  percent.",
                        "The Committee judges that the case for an increase in the federal\nfunds rate has strengthened but decided, for the time being, to wait for further evidence of\ncontinued progress toward its objectives.",
                        "The stance of monetary policy remains\naccommodative, thereby supporting further improvement in labor market conditions and a return\nto 2 percent inflation.\nIn determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds\nrate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its\nobjectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.",
                        "This assessment will take into\naccount a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators\nof inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international\ndevelopments.",
