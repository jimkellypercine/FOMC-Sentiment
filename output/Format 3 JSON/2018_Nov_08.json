                        "Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in September indicates that\nthe labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has been rising at a\nstrong rate.",
                        "Job gains have been strong, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment\nrate has declined.",
                        "Household spending has continued to grow strongly, while growth of business\nfixed investment has moderated from its rapid pace earlier in the year.",
                        "On a 12-month basis,\nboth overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy remain near 2 percent.\nIndicators of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance.\nConsistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and\nprice stability.",
                        "The Committee expects that further gradual increases in the target range for the\nfederal funds rate will be consistent with sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor\nmarket conditions, and inflation near the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective over the\nmedium term.",
                        "Risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced.\nIn view of realized and expected labor market conditions and inflation, the Committee decided to\nmaintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 2 to 2- percent.\nIn determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds\nrate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its\nmaximum employment objective and its symmetric 2 percent inflation objective.",
                        "This\nassessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor\nmarket conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on\nfinancial and international developments."
