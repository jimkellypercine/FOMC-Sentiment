                        "Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in September indicates that\nthe labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has been rising at a\nsolid rate despite hurricane-related disruptions.",
                        "Although the hurricanes caused a drop in payroll\nemployment in September, the unemployment rate declined further.",
                        "Household spending has\nbeen expanding at a moderate rate, and growth in business fixed investment has picked up in\nrecent quarters.",
                        "Gasoline prices rose in the aftermath of the hurricanes, boosting overall\ninflation in September; however, inflation for items other than food and energy remained soft.",
                        "On\na 12-month basis, both inflation measures have declined this year and are running below 2\npercent.",
                        "Marketbased measures\nof longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance.\nConsistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and\nprice stability.",
                        "Hurricane-related disruptions and rebuilding will continue to affect economic\nactivity, employment, and inflation in the near term, but past experience suggests that the\nstorms are unlikely to materially alter the course of the national economy over the medium term.\nConsequently, the Committee continues to expect that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of\nmonetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace, and labor market conditions\nwill strengthen somewhat further.",
                        "Inflation on a 12-month basis is expected to remain somewhat\nbelow 2 percent in the near term but to stabilize around the Committee's 2 percent objective\nover the medium term.",
                        "Near-term risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced, but\nthe Committee is monitoring inflation developments closely.\nIn view of realized and expected labor market conditions and inflation, the Committee decided to\nmaintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 1 to 1- percent.",
                        "The stance of monetary\npolicy remains accommodative, thereby supporting some further strengthening in labor market\nconditions and a sustained return to 2 percent inflation.\nIn determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds\nrate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its\nobjectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.",
                        "This assessment will take into\naccount a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators\nof inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international"
