                        "Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in March indicates that the\nlabor market remains strong and that economic activity rose at a solid rate.",
                        "Job gains have been\nsolid, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate has remained low.",
                        "Growth of\nhousehold spending and business fixed investment slowed in the first quarter.",
                        "On a 12-month\nbasis, overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy have declined and are\nrunning below 2 percent.",
                        "On balance, market-based measures of inflation compensation have\nremained low in recent months, and surveyterm inflation\nexpectations are little changed.\nConsistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and\nprice stability.",
                        "In support of these goals, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for\nthe federal funds rate at  percent.",
                        "The Committee continues to view sustained\nexpansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the\nCommittee's symmetric 2 percent objective as the most likely outcomes.",
                        "In light of global\neconomic and financial developments and muted inflation pressures, the Committee will be\npatient as it determines what future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate\nmay be appropriate to support these outcomes.\nIn determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds\nrate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its\nmaximum employment objective and its symmetric 2 percent inflation objective.",
                        "This\nassessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor\nmarket conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on\nfinancial and international developments."
