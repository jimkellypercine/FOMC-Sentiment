                        "Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in May indicates that the\nlabor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has been rising moderately\nso far this year.",
                        "Job gains have moderated but have been solid, on average, since the beginning\nof the year, and the unemployment rate has declined.",
                        "Household spending has picked up in\nrecent months, and business fixed investment has continued to expand.",
                        "On a 12-month basis,\ninflation has declined recently and, like the measure excluding food and energy prices, is\nrunning somewhat below 2 percent.",
                        "Market-based measures of inflation compensation remain\nlow; surveyterm inflation expectations are little changed, on balance.\nConsistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and\nprice stability.",
                        "The Committee continues to expect that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of\nmonetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace, and labor market conditions\nwill strengthen somewhat further.",
                        "Inflation on a 12-month basis is expected to remain somewhat\nbelow 2 percent in the near term but to stabilize around the Committee's 2 percent objective\nover the medium term.",
                        "Near-term risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced, but\nthe Committee is monitoring inflation developments closely.\nIn view of realized and expected labor market conditions and inflation, the Committee decided to\nraise the target range for the federal funds rate to 1 to 1- percent.",
                        "The stance of monetary\npolicy remains accommodative, thereby supporting some further strengthening in labor market\nconditions and a sustained return to 2 percent inflation.\nIn determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds\nrate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its\nobjectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.",
                        "This assessment will take into\naccount a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators\nof inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international\ndevelopments.",
                        "The Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected inflation developments\nrelative to its symmetric inflation goal.",
                        "The Committee expects that economic conditions will\nevolve in a manner that will warrant gradual increases in the federal funds rate; the federal\nfunds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the"
