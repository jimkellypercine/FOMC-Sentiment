                        "Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in June suggests that\neconomic activity expanded at a modest pace during the first half of the year.",
                        "Labor market\nconditions have shown further improvement in recent months, on balance, but the\nunemployment rate remains elevated.",
                        "Household spending and business fixed investment\nadvanced, and the housing sector has been strengthening, but mortgage rates have risen\nsomewhat and fiscal policy is restraining economic growth.",
                        "Partly reflecting transitory influences,\ninflation has been running below the Committee's longerterm inflation\nexpectations have remained stable.\nConsistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and\nprice stability.",
                        "The Committee expects that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic\ngrowth will pick up from its recent pace and the unemployment rate will gradually decline toward\nlevels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate.",
