                        "Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in May indicates that the\nlabor market remains strong and that economic activity is rising at a moderate rate.",
                        "Job gains\nhave been solid, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate has remained low.\nAlthough growth of household spending appears to have picked up from earlier in the year,\nindicators of business fixed investment have been soft.",
                        "On a 12-month basis, overall inflation\nand inflation for items other than food and energy are running below 2 percent.",
                        "Market-based\nmeasures of inflation compensation have declined; surveyterm\ninflation expectations are little changed.\nConsistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and\nprice stability.",
                        "In support of these goals, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for\nthe federal funds rate at  percent.",
                        "The Committee continues to view sustained\nexpansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the\nCommittee's symmetric 2 percent objective as the most likely outcomes, but uncertainties about\nthis outlook have increased.",
                        "In light of these uncertainties and muted inflation pressures, the\nCommittee will closely monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook\nand will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion, with a strong labor market and inflation\nnear its symmetric 2 percent objective.\nIn determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds\nrate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its\nmaximum employment objective and its symmetric 2 percent inflation objective.",
                        "This\nassessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor\nmarket conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on\nfinancial and international developments."
