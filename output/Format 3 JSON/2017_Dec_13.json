                        "Averaging through hurricane-related fluctuations, job gains have been solid, and the\nunemployment rate declined further.",
                        "Household spending has been expanding at a moderate\nrate, and growth in business fixed investment has picked up in recent quarters.",
                        "On a 12-month\nbasis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy have declined this\nyear and are running below 2 percent.",
                        "Market-based measures of inflation compensation remain\nlow; surveyterm inflation expectations are little changed, on balance.\nConsistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and\nprice stability.",

                        "This assessment will take into\naccount a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators\nof inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international\ndevelopments.",
