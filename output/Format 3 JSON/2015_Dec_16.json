                        "Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in October suggests that\neconomic activity has been expanding at a moderate pace.",
                        "Household spending and business\nfixed investment have been increasing at solid rates in recent months, and the housing sector\nhas improved further; however, net exports have been soft.",
                        "A range of recent labor market\nindicators, including ongoing job gains and declining unemployment, shows further improvement\nand confirms that underutilization of labor resources has diminished appreciably since early this\nyear.",
                        "Inflation has continued to run below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run objective, partly\nreflecting declines in energy prices and in prices of nonbased\nmeasures of inflation compensation remain low; some surveyterm\ninflation expectations have edged down.\nConsistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and\nprice stability.",
                        "The Committee currently expects that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of\nmonetary policy, economic activity will continue to expand at a moderate pace and labor market\nindicators will continue to strengthen.",

                        "The Committee continues to monitor inflation developments closely.\nThe Committee judges that there has been considerable improvement in labor market\nconditions this year, and it is reasonably confident that inflation will rise, over the medium term,\nto its 2 percent objective.",
                        "Given the economic outlook, and recognizing the time it takes for\npolicy actions to affect future economic outcomes, the Committee decided to raise the target\nrange for the federal funds rate to  to  percent.",
                        "The stance of monetary policy remains\naccommodative after this increase, thereby supporting further improvement in labor market\nconditions and a return to 2 percent inflation.\nIn determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds\nrate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its\nobjectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.",
