                        "Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in January suggests that\nthe economy has been expanding moderately.",
                        "Labor market conditions have improved further;\nthe unemployment rate has declined notably in recent months but remains elevated.",
                        "Household\nspending and business fixed investment have continued to advance.",
                        "The housing sector\nremains depressed.",
                        "Inflation has been subdued in recent months, although prices of crude oil\nand gasoline have increased lately.",
                        "Longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable.\nConsistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and\nprice stability.",
                        "The Committee expects moderate economic growth over coming quarters and\nconsequently anticipates that the unemployment rate will decline gradually toward levels that the\nCommittee judges to be consistent with its dual mandate.",
                        "Strains in global financial markets\nhave eased, though they continue to pose significant downside risks to the economic outlook.\nThe recent increase in oil and gasoline prices will push up inflation temporarily, but the\nCommittee anticipates that subsequently inflation will run at or below the rate that it judges most\nconsistent with its dual mandate.\nTo support a stronger economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at the\nrate most consistent with its dual mandate, the Committee expects to maintain a highly\naccommodative stance for monetary policy.",
                        "In particular, the Committee decided today to keep\nthe target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to  percent and currently anticipates that\neconomic conditionsincluding low rates of resource utilization and a subdued outlook for\ninflation over the medium runare likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds\nrate at least through late 2014.\nThe Committee also decided to continue its program to extend the average maturity of its\nholdings of securities as announced in September.",
                        "The Committee is maintaining its existing\npolicies of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency\nmortgagebacked securities and of rolling over maturing\nTreasury securities at auction.",
                        "The Committee will regularly review the size and composition of\nits securities holdings and is prepared to adjust those holdings as appropriate to promote a\nstronger economic recovery in a context of price stability."
