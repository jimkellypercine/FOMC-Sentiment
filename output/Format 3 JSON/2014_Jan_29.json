                        "The Committee expects that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic\nactivity will expand at a moderate pace and the unemployment rate will gradually decline toward\nlevels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate.",
                        "The Committee sees the risks to\nthe outlook for the economy and the labor market as having become more nearly balanced.",
                        "The\nCommittee recognizes that inflation persistently below its 2 percent objective could pose risks to\neconomic performance, and it is monitoring inflation developments carefully for evidence that\ninflation will move back toward its objective over the medium term.\nTaking into account the extent of federal fiscal retrenchment since the inception of its current\nasset purchase program, the Committee continues to see the improvement in economic activity\nand labor market conditions over that period as consistent with growing underlying strength in\nthe broader economy.",
                        "In light of the cumulative progress toward maximum employment and the\nimprovement in the outlook for labor market conditions, the Committee decided to make a\nfurther measured reduction in the pace of its asset purchases.",
                        "Beginning in February, the\nCommittee will add to its holdings of agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of $30 billion\nper month rather than $35 billion per month, and will add to its holdings of longer-term Treasury\nsecurities at a pace of $35 billion per month rather than $40 billion per month.",

                        "accommodative, which in turn should promote a stronger economic recovery and help to ensure\nthat inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with the Committee's dual mandate.\nThe Committee will closely monitor incoming information on economic and financial\ndevelopments in coming months and will continue its purchases of Treasury and agency\nmortgage-backed securities, and employ its other \u00a0policy tools as appropriate, until the outlook\nfor the labor market has improved substantially in a context of price stability.",
                        "If incoming\ninformation broadly supports the Committee's expectation of ongoing improvement in labor\nmarket conditions and inflation moving back toward its longer-run objective, the Committee will\nlikely reduce the pace of asset purchases in further measured steps at future meetings.\nHowever, asset purchases are not on a preset course, and the Committee's decisions about\ntheir pace will remain contingent on the Committee's outlook for the labor market and inflation as\nwell as its assessment of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases.\nTo support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee\ntoday reaffirmed its view that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain\nappropriate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends and the economic\nrecovery strengthens.",
                        "The Committee also reaffirmed its expectation that the current\nexceptionally low target range for the federal funds rate of 0 to  percent will be appropriate at\nleast as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6- percent, inflation between one and\ntwo years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the Committee's\n2 percent longerterm inflation expectations continue to be well anchored.\nIn determining how long to maintain a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy, the\nCommittee will also consider other information, including additional measures of labor market\nconditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial\ndevelopments.",
                        "The Committee continues to anticipate, based on its assessment of these\nfactors, that it likely will be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds\nrate well past the time that the unemployment rate declines below 6- percent, especially if\nprojected inflation continues to run below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal.",
                        "When the\nCommittee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach\nconsistent with its longer-run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent."
