                        "Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in January suggests a\nreturn to moderate economic growth following a pause late last year.\u00a0 Labor market conditions\nhave shown signs of improvement in recent months but the unemployment rate remains\nelevated.\u00a0 Household spending and business fixed investment advanced, and the housing\nsector has strengthened further, but fiscal policy has become somewhat more restrictive.\u00a0\nInflation has been running somewhat below the Committee's longer-run objective, apart from\ntemporary variations that largely reflect fluctuations in energy prices.\u00a0 Longer-term inflation\nexpectations have remained stable.\nConsistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and\nprice stability.\u00a0 The Committee expects that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic\ngrowth will proceed at a moderate pace and the unemployment rate will gradually decline\ntoward levels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate.\u00a0 The Committee continues\nto see downside risks to the economic outlook.\u00a0 The Committee also anticipates that inflation\nover the medium term likely will run at or below its 2 percent objective.\nTo support a stronger economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at the\nrate most consistent with its dual mandate, the Committee decided to continue purchasing\nadditional agency mortgage\nterm Treasury securities at a pace of $45 billion per month.\u00a0 The Committee is maintaining its\nexisting policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency\nmortgagebacked securities and of rolling over maturing\nTreasury securities at auction.\u00a0 Taken together, these actions should maintain downward\npressure on longer-term interest rates, support mortgage markets, and help to make broader\nfinancial conditions more accommodative.\nThe Committee will closely monitor incoming information on economic and financial\ndevelopments in coming months.\u00a0 The Committee will continue its purchases of Treasury and\nagency mortgage-backed securities, and employ its other policy tools as appropriate, until the\noutlook for the labor market has improved substantially in a context of price stability.\u00a0 In\ndetermining the size, pace, and composition of its asset purchases, the Committee will continue\nto take appropriate account of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases as well as the\nextent of progress toward its economic objectives."
