                        "Household spending and business fixed investment advanced, and the\nhousing sector has been strengthening, but mortgage rates have risen further and fiscal policy is\nrestraining economic growth.",
                        "Apart from fluctuations due to changes in energy prices, inflation\nhas been running below the Committee's longerterm inflation\nexpectations have remained stable.\nConsistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and\nprice stability.",
