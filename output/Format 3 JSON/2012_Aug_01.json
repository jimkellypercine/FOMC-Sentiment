                        "Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in June suggests that\neconomic activity decelerated somewhat over the first half of this year.",
                        "Growth in employment\nhas been slow in recent months, and the unemployment rate remains elevated.",
                        "Business fixed\ninvestment has continued to advance.",
                        "Household spending has been rising at a somewhat\nslower pace than earlier in the year.",
                        "Despite some further signs of improvement, the housing\nsector remains depressed.",
                        "Inflation has declined since earlier this year, mainly reflecting lower\nprices of crude oil and gasoline, and longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable.\nConsistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and\nprice stability.",
                        "The Committee expects economic growth to remain moderate over coming\nquarters and then to pick up very gradually.",
                        "Consequently, the Committee anticipates that the\nunemployment rate will decline only slowly toward levels that it judges to be consistent with its\ndual mandate.",
                        "Furthermore, strains in global financial markets continue to pose significant\ndownside risks to the economic outlook.",
                        "The Committee anticipates that inflation over the\nmedium term will run at or below the rate that it judges most consistent with its dual mandate.\nTo support a stronger economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at the\nrate most consistent with its dual mandate, the Committee expects to maintain a highly\naccommodative stance for monetary policy.",
                        "In particular, the Committee decided today to keep\nthe target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to  percent and currently anticipates that\neconomic conditionsincluding low rates of resource utilization and a subdued outlook for\ninflation over the medium runare likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds\nrate at least through late 2014.\nThe Committee also decided to continue through the end of the year its program to extend the\naverage maturity of its holdings of securities as announced in June, and it is maintaining its\nexisting policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency\nmortgagebacked securities.",
                        "The Committee will closely\nmonitor incoming information on economic and financial developments and will provide\nadditional accommodation as needed to promote a stronger economic recovery and sustained\nimprovement in labor market conditions in a context of price stability."
