                        "Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in March indicates that the\nlabor market has continued to strengthen even as growth in economic activity slowed.",
                        "Job gains\nwere solid, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate declined.",
                        "Household\nspending rose only modestly, but the fundamentals underpinning the continued growth of\nconsumption remained solid.",
                        "Business fixed investment firmed.",
                        "Inflation measured on a 12-\nmonth basis recently has been running close to the Committee's 2 percent longer-run objective.\nExcluding energy and food, consumer prices declined in March and inflation continued to run\nsomewhat below 2 percent.",
                        "Market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low;\nsurveyterm inflation expectations are little changed, on balance.\nConsistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and\nprice stability.",

                        "The Committee continues to closely\nmonitor inflation indicators and global economic and financial developments.\nIn view of realized and expected labor market conditions and inflation, the Committee decided to\nmaintain the target range for the federal funds rate at  to 1 percent.",
                        "The stance of monetary\npolicy remains accommodative, thereby supporting some further strengthening in labor market\nconditions and a sustained return to 2 percent inflation.\nIn determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds\nrate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its\nobjectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.",
                        "This assessment will take into\naccount a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators\nof inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international\ndevelopments.",
                        "The Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected inflation developments\nrelative to its symmetric inflation goal.",
                        "The Committee expects that economic conditions will\nevolve in a manner that will warrant gradual increases in the federal funds rate; the federal\nfunds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the"
