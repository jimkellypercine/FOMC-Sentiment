                        "Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in October suggests that\neconomic activity is expanding at a moderate pace.",
                        "Labor market conditions improved further,\nwith solid job gains and a lower unemployment rate.",
                        "On balance, a range of labor market\nindicators suggests that underutilization of labor resources continues to diminish.",
                        "Household\nspending is rising moderately and business fixed investment is advancing, while the recovery in\nthe housing sector remains slow.",
                        "Inflation has continued to run below the Committee's longer-\nrun objective, partly reflecting declines in energy prices.",
                        "Market-based measures of inflation\ncompensation have declined somewhat further; surveyterm inflation\nexpectations have remained stable.\nConsistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and\nprice stability.",
                        "The Committee expects that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic\nactivity will expand at a moderate pace, with labor market indicators moving toward levels the\nCommittee judges consistent with its dual mandate.",
                        "The Committee sees the risks to the outlook\nfor economic activity and the labor market as nearly balanced.",
                        "The Committee expects inflation\nto rise gradually toward 2 percent as the labor market improves further and the transitory effects\nof lower energy prices and other factors dissipate.",
                        "The Committee continues to monitor inflation\ndevelopments closely.\nTo support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee\ntoday reaffirmed its view that the current 0 to  percent target range for the federal funds rate\nremains appropriate.",
                        "In determining how long to maintain this target range, the Committee will\nassess progressboth realized and expectedtoward its objectives of maximum employment\nand 2 percent inflation.",
                        "This assessment will take into account a wide range of information,\nincluding measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation\nexpectations, and readings on financial developments.",
                        "Based on its current assessment, the\nCommittee judges that it can be patient in beginning to normalize the stance of monetary policy.\nThe Committee sees this guidance as consistent with its previous statement that it likely will be\nappropriate to maintain the 0 to  percent target range for the federal funds rate for a\nconsiderable time following the end of its asset purchase program in October, especially if\nprojected inflation continues to run below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and\nprovided that longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored.",
