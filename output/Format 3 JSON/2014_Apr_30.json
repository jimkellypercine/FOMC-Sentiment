                        "Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in March indicates that\ngrowth in economic activity has picked up recently, after having slowed sharply during the winter\nin part because of adverse weather conditions.",
                        "Labor market indicators were mixed but on\nbalance showed further improvement.",
                        "The unemployment rate, however, remains elevated.\nHousehold spending appears to be rising more quickly.",
