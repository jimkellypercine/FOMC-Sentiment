                        "Household spending and business fixed investment advanced, and the housing sector\nhas strengthened further, but fiscal policy is restraining economic growth.",
                        "Partly reflecting\ntransitory influences, inflation has been running below the Committee's longer-run objective, but\nlonger-term inflation expectations have remained stable.\nConsistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and\nprice stability.",
