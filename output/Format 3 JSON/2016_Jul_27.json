                        "Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in June indicates that the\nlabor market strengthened and that economic activity has been expanding at a moderate rate.\nJob gains were strong in June following weak growth in May.",
                        "On balance, payrolls and other\nlabor market indicators point to some increase in labor utilization in recent months.",
                        "Household\nspending has been growing strongly but business fixed investment has been soft.",
                        "Inflation has\ncontinued to run below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run objective, partly reflecting earlier\ndeclines in energy prices and in prices of nonbased measures of\ninflation compensation remain low; most surveyterm inflation\nexpectations are little changed, on balance, in recent months.\nConsistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and\nprice stability.",
                        "The Committee currently expects that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of\nmonetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace and labor market indicators\nwill strengthen.",
                        "Inflation is expected to remain low in the near term, in part because of earlier\ndeclines in energy prices, but to rise to 2 percent over the medium term as the transitory effects\nof past declines in energy and import prices dissipate and the labor market strengthens further.\nNear-term risks to the economic outlook have diminished.",
                        "The Committee continues to closely\nmonitor inflation indicators and global economic and financial developments.\nAgainst this backdrop, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds\nrate at  to  percent.",
                        "The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby\nsupporting further improvement in labor market conditions and a return to 2 percent inflation.\nIn determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds\nrate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its\nobjectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.",
                        "This assessment will take into\naccount a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators\nof inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international\ndevelopments.",
                        "In light of the current shortfall of inflation from 2 percent, the Committee will\ncarefully monitor actual and expected progress toward its inflation goal.",
                        "The Committee expects\nthat economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant only gradual increases in the\nfederal funds rate; the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are"
