                        "Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in November indicates that\nthe labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has been rising at a\nstrong rate.",
                        "Job gains have been strong, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment\nrate has remained low.",
                        "Household spending has continued to grow strongly, while growth of\nbusiness fixed investment has moderated from its rapid pace earlier in the year.",
                        "On a 12-month\nbasis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy remain near 2\npercent.",
                        "Indicators of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance.\nConsistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and\nprice stability.",
                        "The Committee judges that some further gradual increases in the target range for\nthe federal funds rate will be consistent with sustained expansion of economic activity, strong\nlabor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective over\nthe medium term.",
                        "The Committee judges that risks to the economic outlook are roughly\nbalanced, but will continue to monitor global economic and financial developments and assess\ntheir implications for the economic outlook.\nIn view of realized and expected labor market conditions and inflation, the Committee decided to\nraise the target range for the federal funds rate to 2- to 2\u2011 percent.\nIn determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds\nrate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its\nmaximum employment objective and its symmetric 2 percent inflation objective.",
                        "This\nassessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor\nmarket conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on\nfinancial and international developments."
