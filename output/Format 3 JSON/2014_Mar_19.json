                        "Inflation\nhas been running below the Committee's longerterm inflation\nexpectations have remained stable.\nConsistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and\nprice stability.",
                        "The Committee expects that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic\nactivity will expand at a moderate pace and labor market conditions will continue to improve\ngradually, moving toward those the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate.",
                        "The\nCommittee sees the risks to the outlook for the economy and the labor market as nearly\nbalanced.",
                        "The Committee recognizes that inflation persistently below its 2 percent objective\ncould pose risks to economic performance, and it is monitoring inflation developments carefully\nfor evidence that inflation will move back toward its objective over the medium term.\nThe Committee currently judges that there is sufficient underlying strength in the broader\neconomy to support ongoing improvement in labor market conditions.",
                        "In light of the cumulative\nprogress toward maximum employment and the improvement in the outlook for labor market\nconditions since the inception of the current asset purchase program, the Committee decided to\nmake a further measured reduction in the pace of its asset purchases.",
                        "Beginning in April, the\nCommittee will add to its holdings of agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of $25 billion\nper month rather than $30 billion per month, and will add to its holdings of longer-term Treasury\nsecurities at a pace of $30 billion per month rather than $35 billion per month.",
                        "The Committee is\nmaintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt\nand agency mortgagebacked securities and of rolling\nover maturing Treasury securities at auction.",

                        "If incoming\ninformation broadly supports the Committee's expectation of ongoing improvement in labor\nmarket conditions and inflation moving back toward its longer-run objective, the Committee will\nlikely reduce the pace of asset purchases in further measured steps at future meetings.\nHowever, asset purchases are not on a preset course, and the Committee's decisions about\ntheir pace will remain contingent on the Committee's outlook for the labor market and inflation as\nwell as its assessment of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases.\nTo support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee\ntoday reaffirmed its view that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy remains\nappropriate.",

                        "The Committee currently anticipates that, even after employment and inflation are near\nmandate-consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target\nfederal funds rate below levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run.\nWith the unemployment rate nearing 6- percent, the Committee has updated its forward\nguidance.",
                        "The change in the Committee's guidance does not indicate any change in the\nCommittee's policy intentions as set forth in its recent statements."
