                        "Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in December suggests that\ngrowth in economic activity paused in recent months, in large part because of weather-related\ndisruptions and other transitory factors.",
                        "Employment has continued to expand at a moderate\npace but the unemployment rate remains elevated.",
                        "Household spending and business fixed\ninvestment advanced, and the housing sector has shown further improvement.",
                        "Inflation has\nbeen running somewhat below the Committee\u2019s longer-run objective, apart from temporary\nvariations that largely reflect fluctuations in energy prices.",
                        "Longer-term inflation expectations\nhave remained stable.\nConsistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and\nprice stability.",
                        "The Committee expects that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic\ngrowth will proceed at a moderate pace and the unemployment rate will gradually decline\ntoward levels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate.\u00a0 Although strains in global\nfinancial markets have eased somewhat, the Committee continues to see downside risks to the\neconomic outlook.",

                        "The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of\nreinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed\nsecurities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities\nat auction.",
                        "Taken together, these actions should maintain downward pressure on \u00a0longer-term\ninterest rates, support mortgage markets, and help to make broader financial conditions more\naccommodative.\nThe Committee will closely monitor incoming information on economic and financial\ndevelopments in coming months.",
                        "If the outlook for the labor market does not improve\nsubstantially, the Committee will continue its purchases of Treasury and agency mortgage-\nbacked securities, and employ its other policy tools as appropriate, until such improvement is\nachieved in a context of price stability.",
