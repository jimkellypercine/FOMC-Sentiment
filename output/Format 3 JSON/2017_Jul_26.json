                        "Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in June indicates that the\nlabor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has been rising moderately\nso far this year.",
                        "Job gains have been solid, on average, since the beginning of the year, and the\nunemployment rate has declined.",
                        "Household spending and business fixed investment have\ncontinued to expand.",
                        "On a 12-month basis, overall inflation and the measure excluding food and\nenergy prices have declined and are running below 2 percent.",
                        "Market-based measures of\ninflation compensation remain low; surveyterm inflation expectations\nare little changed, on balance.\nConsistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and\nprice stability.",

                        "This assessment will take into\naccount a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators\nof inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international\ndevelopments.",
