                        "Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in April indicates that the\npace of improvement in the labor market has slowed while growth in economic activity appears\nto have picked up.",
                        "Although the unemployment rate has declined, job gains have diminished.\nGrowth in household spending has strengthened.",
                        "Since the beginning of the year, the housing\nsector has continued to improve and the drag from net exports appears to have lessened, but\nbusiness fixed investment has been soft.",
                        "Inflation has continued to run below the Committee's 2\npercent longer-run objective, partly reflecting earlier declines in energy prices and in prices of\nnonbased measures of inflation compensation declined; most survey-\nbased measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance, in recent\nmonths.\nConsistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and\nprice stability.",
                        "The Committee currently expects that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of\nmonetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace and labor market indicators\nwill strengthen.",
                        "Inflation is expected to remain low in the near term, in part because of earlier\ndeclines in energy prices, but to rise to 2 percent over the medium term as the transitory effects\nof past declines in energy and import prices dissipate and the labor market strengthens further.\nThe Committee continues to closely monitor inflation indicators and global economic and\nfinancial developments.\nAgainst this backdrop, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds\nrate at  to  percent.",
                        "The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby\nsupporting further improvement in labor market conditions and a return to 2 percent inflation.\nIn determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds\nrate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its\nobjectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.",
                        "This assessment will take into\naccount a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators\nof inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international\ndevelopments.",
                        "In light of the current shortfall of inflation from 2 percent, the Committee will\ncarefully monitor actual and expected progress toward its inflation goal.",
                        "The Committee expects\nthat economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant only gradual increases in the\nfederal funds rate; the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are"
