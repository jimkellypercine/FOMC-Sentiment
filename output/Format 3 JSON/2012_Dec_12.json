                        "Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in October suggests that\neconomic activity and employment have continued to expand at a moderate pace in recent\nmonths, apart from weather-related disruptions.",
                        "Although the unemployment rate has declined\nsomewhat since the summer, it remains elevated.",
                        "Household spending has continued to\nadvance, and the housing sector has shown further signs of improvement, but growth in\nbusiness fixed investment has slowed.",
                        "Inflation has been running somewhat below the\nCommittee\u2019s longer-run objective, apart from temporary variations that largely reflect fluctuations\nin energy prices.",
                        "Longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable.\nConsistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and\nprice stability.",
                        "The Committee remains concerned that, without sufficient policy accommodation,\neconomic growth might not be strong enough to generate sustained improvement in labor\nmarket conditions.",

                        "The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal\npayments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency\nmortgage-backed securities and, in January, will resume rolling over maturing Treasury\nsecurities at auction.",
                        "Taken together, these actions should maintain downward pressure on\nlonger-term interest rates, support mortgage markets, and help to make broader financial\nconditions more accommodative.\nThe Committee will closely monitor incoming information on economic and financial\ndevelopments in coming months.",
                        "If the outlook for the labor market does not improve\nsubstantially, the Committee will continue its purchases of Treasury and agency mortgage-\nbacked securities, and employ its other policy tools as appropriate, until such improvement is\nachieved in a context of price stability.",
