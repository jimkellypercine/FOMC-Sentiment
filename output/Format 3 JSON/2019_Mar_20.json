                        "Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in January indicates that\nthe labor market remains strong but that growth of economic activity has slowed from its solid\nrate in the fourth quarter.",
                        "Payroll employment was little changed in February, but job gains have\nbeen solid, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate has remained low.",
                        "Recent\nindicators point to slower growth of household spending and business fixed investment in the\nfirst quarter.",
                        "On a 12-month basis, overall inflation has declined, largely as a result of lower\nenergy prices; inflation for items other than food and energy remains near 2 percent.",
                        "On\nbalance, market-based measures of inflation compensation have remained low in recent\nmonths, and surveyterm inflation expectations are little changed.\nConsistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and\nprice stability.",
                        "In support of these goals, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for\nthe federal funds rate at  percent.",
                        "The Committee continues to view sustained\nexpansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the\nCommittee's symmetric 2 percent objective as the most likely outcomes.",
                        "In light of global\neconomic and financial developments and muted inflation pressures, the Committee will be\npatient as it determines what future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate\nmay be appropriate to support these outcomes.\nIn determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds\nrate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its\nmaximum employment objective and its symmetric 2 percent inflation objective.",
                        "This\nassessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor\nmarket conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on\nfinancial and international developments."
