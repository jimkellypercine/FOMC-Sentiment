                        "Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in June indicates that the\nlabor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has been rising at a strong\nrate.",
                        "Job gains have been strong, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate\nhas stayed low.",
                        "Household spending and business fixed investment have grown strongly.",
                        "On a\n12-month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy remain\nnear 2 percent.",
                        "Indicators of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance.\nConsistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and\nprice stability.",
                        "The Committee expects that further gradual increases in the target range for the\nfederal funds rate will be consistent with sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor\nmarket conditions, and inflation near the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective over the\nmedium term.",
                        "Risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced.\nIn view of realized and expected labor market conditions and inflation, the Committee decided to\nmaintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 1- to 2 percent.",
                        "The stance of monetary\npolicy remains accommodative, thereby supporting strong labor market conditions and a\nsustained return to 2 percent inflation.\nIn determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds\nrate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its\nmaximum employment objective and its symmetric 2 percent inflation objective.",
                        "This\nassessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor\nmarket conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on\nfinancial and international developments."
