                        "A range of labor market indicators\nsuggests that underutilization of labor resources continues to diminish.",
                        "Household spending is\nrising moderately; declines in energy prices have boosted household purchasing power.\nBusiness fixed investment is advancing, while the recovery in the housing sector remains slow\nand export growth has weakened.",
                        "Inflation has declined further below the Committee's longer-\nrun objective, largely reflecting declines in energy prices.",
                        "Market-based measures of inflation\ncompensation remain low; surveyterm inflation expectations have\nremained stable.\nConsistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and\nprice stability.",
                        "The Committee expects that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic\nactivity will expand at a moderate pace, with labor market indicators continuing to move toward\nlevels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate.",
