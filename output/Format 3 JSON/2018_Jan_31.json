                        "Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in December indicates that\nthe labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has been rising at a\nsolid rate.",
                        "Gains in employment, household spending, and business fixed investment have been\nsolid, and the unemployment rate has stayed low.",
                        "On a 12-month basis, both overall inflation\nand inflation for items other than food and energy have continued to run below 2 percent.\nMarket-based measures of inflation compensation have increased in recent months but remain\nlow; surveyterm inflation expectations are little changed, on balance.\nConsistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and\nprice stability.",
                        "The Committee expects that, with further gradual adjustments in the stance of\nmonetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace and labor market conditions\nwill remain strong.",
                        "Inflation on a 12\u2011month basis is expected to move up this year and to\nstabilize around the Committee's 2 percent objective over the medium term.",
                        "Near-term risks to\nthe economic outlook appear roughly balanced, but the Committee is monitoring inflation\ndevelopments closely.\nIn view of realized and expected labor market conditions and inflation, the Committee decided to\nmaintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 1- to 1\u2011 percent.",
                        "The stance of\nmonetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting strong labor market conditions and\na sustained return to 2 percent inflation.\nIn determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds\nrate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its\nobjectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.",
                        "This assessment will take into\naccount a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators\nof inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international\ndevelopments.",
                        "The Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected inflation developments\nrelative to its symmetric inflation goal.",
                        "The Committee expects that economic conditions will\nevolve in a manner that will warrant further gradual increases in the federal funds rate; the\nfederal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in\nthe longer run.",
                        "However, the actual path of the federal funds rate will depend on the economic\noutlook as informed by incoming data."
