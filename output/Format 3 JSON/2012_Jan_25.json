                        "Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in December suggests that\nthe economy has been expanding moderately, notwithstanding some slowing in global growth.\nWhile indicators point to some further improvement in overall labor market conditions, the\nunemployment rate remains elevated.",
                        "Household spending has continued to advance, but\ngrowth in business fixed investment has slowed, and the housing sector remains depressed.\nInflation has been subdued in recent months, and longer-term inflation expectations have\nremained stable.\nConsistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and\nprice stability.",
                        "The Committee expects economic growth over coming quarters to be modest and\nconsequently anticipates that the unemployment rate will decline only gradually toward levels\nthat the Committee judges to be consistent with its dual mandate.",
                        "Strains in global financial\nmarkets continue to pose significant downside risks to the economic outlook.",
                        "The Committee\nalso anticipates that over coming quarters, inflation will run at levels at or below those consistent\nwith the Committee's dual mandate.\nTo support a stronger economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at levels\nconsistent with the dual mandate, the Committee expects to maintain a highly accommodative\nstance for monetary policy.\u00a0 In particular, the Committee decided today to keep the target range\nfor the federal funds rate at 0 to  percent and currently anticipates that economic conditions\nincluding low rates of resource utilization and a subdued outlook for inflation over the medium\nrunare likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through late\n2014.\nThe Committee also decided to continue its program to extend the average maturity of its\nholdings of securities as announced in September.",
                        "The Committee is maintaining its existing\npolicies of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency\nmortgagebacked securities and of rolling over maturing\nTreasury securities at auction.",
                        "The Committee will regularly review the size and composition of\nits securities holdings and is prepared to adjust those holdings as appropriate to promote a\nstronger economic recovery in a context of price stability."
